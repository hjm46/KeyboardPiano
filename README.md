# Virtual Keyborad Piano

#### A virtual piano can can play with your computer keyboard on the web

## Idea

I wanted to create this project for three reasons:
* to learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and how they can work toegether
* to create a virtual piano enviroment where I could practice and maintain my piano skill when I don't have access to a physical piano
* to create easy access to a piano for composing music purposes


## How to Use

Once you load the webpage, Virtual Piano will load in the default audios for keys. 
The default audio provides three octaves including the Number Pad. The lowest starts with C3 on the key "Q" and continues with D3 flat on the key "2" (not on the Number Pad), D3 on key "W", E3 flat on key "3" and so on following the key structure of a standard piano and ending with C4 on the key "I".
The second octave starts with C4 on the key "Z", followed by D4 flat on the key "S", D4 on the key "X" and so on ending with C5 on the key with both "," and "<".
The Number Pad contains a third octave without following the struct of a standard piano. The numbers 0-9 and the keys "/" and "*" on the Number Pad employ piano audios chromatically respectivally starting with C5 and ending on C6.
The space bar can be used as a sustain pedal, however the audios will only sustain as long as a real piano
The up and down arrow keys can be used to change the octaves of audios represented by the keys.


## Extra Features
* sustain pedal
* octave shifts
* two octave range with keyboard, three octave range including number pad


## Future

Furthering this proect I hope to:
* fix the pedal bugs
* expand upon the octave shifts to provide more nuanced keyshifts
* update the visual asthetics
